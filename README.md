# SMART_IRRIGATION



Final year academic project implemented using technologies like IOT and Machine learning
‌-Project idea was basically to implement E- farming application
-‌we used weMos D1 mini, Arduino, some sensors for measuring real time temperature, humidity in farm
‌-we used REST API for getting weather forecast report for future days
-We implemented 'Decision tree' algorithm (It is a machine learning algorithm)on server
‌-at the time of implementing decision tree algorithm,we considered the type of plant, current climate report and future climate forecasts so that there can be efficient use of water in farm
‌-we also implemented one Android application by which farmer can easily turn ON/OFF motor from remote location
‌- if automatic decision is taken by server (using decision tree algorithm) then farmer could get notification for the same by Android application
